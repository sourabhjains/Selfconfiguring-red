# Extending RED qdisc in ns-3 to support Self-Configuring RED (SCRED) algorithm

Course Code: CS822

Assignment: #GP1

- Self-Configuring RED (SCRED) [1] is an extension of RED [2]. It inherits all the properities of RED, except static parameters.
- Self configuring RED makes RED parameters adaptive to handle wide variety of traffic.
